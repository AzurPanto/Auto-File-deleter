# Auto-File-deleter
A program that will auto delete the contents of a folder depending on your input (days, months, years).

Choose a folder, then input the number of weeks, days, months or years and the program will delete the contents of the folder periodically
there's also an option to stop the automatic deletion process so that if you selected the wrong folder you can stop it. 
If you would like to have this program run as soon as your compurer launches, follow these instructions(For Windows):
1) Go to your search bar and type run
2) type shell:startup
3) then drag the assets folder and the python code into the startup folder
4) Now the python program will run as a startup app
   When you do this, it doesn't automatically start the code, instead it opens your python code compiler and shows you the code, sorry!
