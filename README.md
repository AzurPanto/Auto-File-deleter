# Auto-File-deleter
A program that will auto delete the contents of a folder depending on your input (days, months, years).

Choose a folder, then input the number of weeks, days, months or years and the program will delete the contents of the folder periodically
there's also an option to stop the automatic deletion process so that if you selected the wrong folder you can stop it. 
THIS PROGRAM DOESNT RUN IN THE BACKGROUND, THE PROGRAM  HAS TO BE RUNNING IN ORDER FOR THE CODE TO WORK
more updates coming soon to make the program better and to run in the background!
